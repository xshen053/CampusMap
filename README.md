## Project Description

- The goal of this project is to build a full-stack web application, which is, a campus map! I learned a lot through the process.

- The languages/tools/technologies I used.

  - [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) - I primarily used java to finish the backend.

  - [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - I used js/ts to build frontend.

  - [React](https://cmake.org/) - I used react to help build frontend.

  - [Spark Java](https://sparkjava.com/) - I used spark java as a micro framework to communicate with frontend.

  - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - I used IntelliJ IDEA as Integrated development environment.

  - [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - I used gitlab as version control system.

  - [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - I used gradle as the build automation tool.

- The input of my project would be two different buildings of Uw Campus.
- The output of my project would be the shortest path visualized in the map between these two buildings.
