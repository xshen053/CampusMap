# Campus Map

Authors: [Xiaxi Shen](https://github.com/xshen053)

## Project Description

- Designing and developing a task scheduler is interesting to us because most of us use some task scheduler software nowadays, such as Microsoft Todo. Therefore, we are curious about the mechanism of how to create a task scheduler. What’s more, the function of the present task scheduler is limited. So if we want to add some new function or features, we can only do them ourselves. Realizing such a task scheduler can not only help us solidify what we learned in CS100, but can also help us improve our ability of time management.

- The goal of this project is to build a full-stack web application, which is, a campus map! I learned a lot through the process.

- The languages/tools/technologies I used.

  - [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) - I primarily used java to finish the backend.

  - [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - I used js/ts to build frontend.

  - [React](https://cmake.org/) - I used react to help build frontend.

  - [Spark Java](https://sparkjava.com/) - I used spark java as a micro framework to communicate with frontend.

  - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - I used IntelliJ IDEA as Integrated development environment.

  - [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - I used gitlab as version control system

  - [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - I used gradle as the build automation tool.

- The input of my project would be two different buildings of Uw Campus.
- The output of my project would be the shortest path visualized in the map between these two buildings.

# Testing

Testing includes unit testing and script testing.

I tested each class and tested expected user inputs and invalid user inputs.
