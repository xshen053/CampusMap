# Create a graph
created graph TNOERD_graph

# Add two nodes
added node b to TNOERD_graph
added node a to TNOERD_graph

# Add two edges
added edge AB from a to b in TNOERD_graph
added edge BA from b to a in TNOERD_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a,
# and outgoing edges from b
TNOERD_graph contains: a b
the children of a in TNOERD_graph are: b(AB)
the children of b in TNOERD_graph are: a(BA)
