# Tests adding two nodes to the graph

# Create a graph
created graph TNZE_graph

# Add two nodes
added node a to TNZE_graph
added node b to TNZE_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a,
# and outgoing edges from b
TNZE_graph contains: a b
the children of a in TNZE_graph are:
the children of b in TNZE_graph are:
