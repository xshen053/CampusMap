# Tests adding two nodes, one edge between two nodes
# and one points to itself

# Create a graph
created graph TNOESD_graph

# Add two nodes
added node a to TNOESD_graph
added node b to TNOESD_graph

# Add one edge
added edge AA from a to a in TNOESD_graph
added edge AB from a to b in TNOESD_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a,
# and outgoing edges from b
TNOESD_graph contains: a b
the children of a in TNOESD_graph are: a(AA) b(AB)
the children of b in TNOESD_graph are:
