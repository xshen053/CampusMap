# Create a graph
created graph SEL

# Add a node
added node n1 to SEL
added node n2 to SEL

# Add an edge
added edge e from n1 to n1 in SEL
added edge e from n1 to n2 in SEL
added edge e from n2 to n2 in SEL

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
SEL contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in SEL are: n1(e) n2(e)
the children of n2 in SEL are: n2(e)
