# Tests adding two nodes to the graph

# Create a graph
created graph TNZER_graph

# Add two nodes
added node b to TNZER_graph
added node a to TNZER_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a,
# and outgoing edges from b
TNZER_graph contains: a b
the children of a in TNZER_graph are:
the children of b in TNZER_graph are:
