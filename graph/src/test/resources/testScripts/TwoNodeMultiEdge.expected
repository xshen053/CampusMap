# Tests adding two nodes, multiple edges to graph.

# Create a graph
created graph TNME_graph

# Add two nodes
added node a to TNME_graph
added node b to TNME_graph

# Add five edges
added edge AA from a to a in TNME_graph
added edge AB1 from a to b in TNME_graph
added edge AB2 from a to b in TNME_graph
added edge BA from b to a in TNME_graph
added edge BB from b to b in TNME_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a,
# and outgoing edges from b
TNME_graph contains: a b
the children of a in TNME_graph are: a(AA) b(AB1) b(AB2)
the children of b in TNME_graph are: a(BA) b(BB)
