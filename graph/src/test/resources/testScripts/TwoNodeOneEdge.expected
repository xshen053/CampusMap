# Tests adding two nodes, one edge between two nodes

# Create a graph
created graph TNOE_graph

# Add two nodes
added node a to TNOE_graph
added node b to TNOE_graph

# Add one edge
added edge AB from a to b in TNOE_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a,
# and outgoing edges from b
TNOE_graph contains: a b
the children of a in TNOE_graph are: b(AB)
the children of b in TNOE_graph are:
