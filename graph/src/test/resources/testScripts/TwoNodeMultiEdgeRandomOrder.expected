# Tests adding two nodes, multiple edges to graph
# Random add order

# Create a graph
created graph TNMERO_graph

# Add two nodes
added node a to TNMERO_graph
added node b to TNMERO_graph

# Add five edges
added edge AA from a to a in TNMERO_graph
added edge BA from b to a in TNMERO_graph
added edge AB2 from a to b in TNMERO_graph
added edge BB from b to b in TNMERO_graph
added edge AB1 from a to b in TNMERO_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a,
# and outgoing edges from b
TNMERO_graph contains: a b
the children of a in TNMERO_graph are: a(AA) b(AB1) b(AB2)
the children of b in TNMERO_graph are: a(BA) b(BB)
